## My Journey: From Paper Trading to Litekite

I started trading in 2020 with no knowledge about the markets, so I used to paper trade. I always wanted an easy-to-use, interactive platform to practice my trades and investments, but I couldn't find a suitable choice back then.

Fast-forward to 2024. I'm a software developer now. With my knowledge of building backend systems and user-friendly websites, I started to envision a simple stock exchange that wouldn't require a Demat account or real money. Anyone could sign up and start trading on the platform to get comfortable with a stockbroker.

### Introducing Litekite

This led me to develop **Litekite**â€”a mock-stock broker that works just like a real broker but doesn't involve real money. This way, you can afford to make mistakes while learning to invest or trade. The cherry on top is that Litekite provides **AI support** (currently in beta). Under the hood, Litekite uses **Google Gemini**, allowing users to analyze their trades and portfolio performance with just a click.

For all my tech bros out there, Litekite is a simple web application built with:

  * **Backend:** Flask (Python) with a PostgreSQL database and SQLAlchemy ORM.
  * **Frontend:** React (TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI.

The project is still under development, and I keep adding more features. The goal is to create a comprehensive mock stock broker that people can use to learn before they start investing in real markets. Experienced investors and traders can also use it to test their strategies, create portfolios they can track over time, and get AI-powered analysis.
