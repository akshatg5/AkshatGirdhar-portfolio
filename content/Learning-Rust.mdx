This is me documenting my journey about learning Rust - never done anything like this. Let's see how it goes.

# Day 1 - 10-01-2025

## Why do I want to learn Rust?

Becaue the internet has made me believe that if you know Rust, you're cool.
A lot of cool people on the internet have claimed that Rust is this magical language to write software in which ensures that if you write it well and it compiles, then it will most likely work. So, to see what the hype is all about, I'm starting this journey of learning Rust. Not sure about how long it will take me, but we're starting.

To start with it - Following this bootcamp from Harkirat.
